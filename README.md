# Deep-Q-Network-with-Clustering-for-Bidding-Optimization

This project proposes a novel approach for Demand-Side Platforms (DSPs) to optimize real-time bidding for online advertising. It leverages a combination of Deep Q-Learning (DQN), clustering, and reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust bids based on past data and behavioral patterns.
